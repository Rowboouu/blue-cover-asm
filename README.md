**Blue - Yung Kai (Assembly Language Cover)**

This project is an assembly language cover of the song "Blue" by Yung Kai, implemented using MIPS assembly and executed in the MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) IDE.

**Features**
- Plays a cover of "Blue" using MIPS assembly.
- Utilizes MARS IDE's built-in sound capabilities.
- Demonstrates basic assembly-level sound synthesis.

**Requirements**

To run this project, you need:
- MARS IDE (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
- A system capable of running Java (since MARS requires Java to function)

**Installation & Setup**

_1. Download and Install MARS IDE_
  1. Go to the MARS official website.
  2. Download the latest version of MARS (.jar file).
  3. Ensure you have Java installed (MARS requires Java 1.5 or later). If Java is not installed, download it from Oracle’s website.

_2. Running the Assembly Code_
  1. Open MARS by double-clicking the downloaded Mars.jar file.
  2. Load the blue.asm file into MARS.
  3. Assemble the code by clicking the Assemble button.
  4. Run the program by clicking the Run button.
  5. Ensure your system's audio is enabled to hear the output.

**Code Structure**
- blue.asm - The main assembly file containing the implementation of the song.
- Uses system calls for sound generation.
- Implements timing delays to match the song’s rhythm.

**Troubleshooting**
- If no sound is heard, ensure your audio output is enabled and check MARS settings under Settings > Enable Sound.
- If MARS does not open, ensure Java is properly installed and added to your system path.
